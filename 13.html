<tr>
    <td> HTML has a more rigid syntax, and it often requires closing tags for elements, even if they are empty</td>
    <td>HTML5 allows for more leniency in syntax. It introduces new elements that are self-closing and doesn't always require closing tags</td>

<tr>
    <td>In classic HTML, adding multimedia elements like audio and video required third-party plugins like Flash.</td>
    <td> HTML5 includes built-in support for audio and video elements, making it much easier to embed multimedia content directly into web pages</td>

<tr>
    <td>Has less strict parsing rules, which can lead to inconsistencies and rendering issues across different browsers.</td>
    <td> Provides a more consistent parsing model, reducing browser compatibility issues.</td>
